# Documentation Location

This repository is transitioning to an external canonical docs repository.

## Canonical Docs

- `https://github.com/lightning-goats/hive-docs` (canonical location)

Migration status: seeded from `cl-hive` docs history; cutover in progress.
Until cutover is complete, docs in this repo remain a transition mirror.

## Current Local Entry Points

- Planning/spec index: `docs/planning/00-INDEX.md`
- Plugin architecture docs: `docs/plugins/`
- Security docs: `docs/security/`
- Testing docs: `docs/testing/`

## Migration Plan

See:

- `docs/planning/16-DOCS-REPO-MIGRATION.md`

For maintainers: use `scripts/docs/export-docs-subtree.sh` to export docs history into the external docs repo.
